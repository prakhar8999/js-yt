console.log(null > -1)
//the reason is that am equality check ( == ) and  comparison ( > < >= <= ) works differently
//Comparison convert null to number treating it as 0
//equality check and comparison works same for undefined it always give false
//=== it checks datatypes also

console.log("2" == 2);
